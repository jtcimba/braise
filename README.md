This is a recipe manager that I am developing using React Native, Supabase, and AWS Lambda Functions. The main function of this project is to store recipes that I find online and write from scratch in one app where I can quickly search and sort. It is a work in progress.

Below are some screenshots of the UI which I designed in Figma:
