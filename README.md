# Braise

This is a recipe manager that I am developing using React Native, PostgreSQL, and a AWS including Lambda Functions, API Gateway, RDS, Amplify, and Cognito. The main function of this project is to store recipes that I find online and write from scratch in one app where I can quickly search and sort. It is a work in progress.

Below are some screenshots of the UI which I designed in Figma
